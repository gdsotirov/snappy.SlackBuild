snappy: Snappy (A fast compressor/decompressor)
snappy:
snappy: Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for
snappy: maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression
snappy: library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable
snappy: compression. For instance, compared to the fastest mode of zlib, Snappy
snappy: is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting
snappy: compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single
snappy: core of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about
snappy: 250 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.
snappy: Snappy is widely used inside Google, in everything from BigTable and
snappy: MapReduce to our internal RPC systems.
snappy: Snappy has previously been referred to as "Zippy".
